New is an easy-peasy shell script for creating new directories and files.

The script itself is intentionally verbose with comments, because shell scripts can be dangerous if you don't understand what's going on, and I want even beginners to be able to understand it.

## Usage

So let's say you need to manually create the directories `/src/` and `/public/` with the files **index.css** and **index.js** in one and **index.html** in the other. Previously, you might have handled it something like this:

```shell-script
$ mkdir src public
$ touch src/index.css src/index.js public/index.html
```

Well, with **new**, you'd be able to take care of it with a single command!

```shell-script
$ new src/index.css,index.js public/index.html
```

Ok, but let's say you want to create the following directories:
 - `/this/is/just/an/example/`
 - `/this/one/too/`
 - `/this/is/necessary/`
 - `/src/`
 
Let's also say you want to create a bunch of files within each. How many different commands would you have to enter? Too many, is what I presuppose.

Lucky you! **New** is especially useful when creating a complicated bunch of files within subdirectories, like this:

```shell-script
$ new this/is/just/an/example/one.html,one.css,one.js this/one/too/two.jsx,two.scss this/is/necessary/ src/three.c
```

Just group all your subdirectories together, separated by a slash (/), and append the argument with all the files you want to create within, separated by commas (,). You can write as many arguments as you'd like, or write a different command for each. Nothing will be overwritten, nothing will be duplicatedâ€”it just works!

## Installation

**New** is a single-file script, so this is what I suggest you do:

**1.** If you don't already have a directory where you keep all your shell scripts, make one now. I suggest `~/bin` or `~/scripts`.

**2.** If you made a new directory in step 1, you probably need to add it to your PATH.

   To add your directory to the path, you can go into your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` (assuming you have one, more info below), and adding the line `export PATH=/your/directory:$PATH`. If you follow the example above, then, you'd add the line `export PATH=~/scripts:$PATH`.

   (If you're new to the command line, PATH is an [environment variable] that contains a list of directories. Your terminal will look inside this list when it's trying to resolve a command or script. This is useful so you don't always have to type out the directory in which the script resides, so instead of typing in `~/scripts/new`, you can just type `new`.) 
   
   (Also, `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` is a [configuration file] for your terminal where you can add all your customizations. It's an easy an worthwhile topic, so you should familiarize yourself with it, and make some customizations of your own. By the way, `.bashrc` is just a regular text file; the dot just indicates it's hidden, as most config files are. You can view all the hidden files within a directory by adding typing `ls -a` into your terminal.)
